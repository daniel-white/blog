I've been mulling over how [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) has
aparently slowed on the x86 architecture and how the rise of strong language support for
asynchronous patterns has happened about the same time.

Have these asynchronous patterns come to help squeak more performance out of dwindling
hardware returns on investment? I would say there's some merit to that, but our machines
_have always been asynchronous_ from the original hardware designs. Operating systems
and libraries have previously taken a large share of the burden to enable developers 
very tight procedural code, at the cost of hurting the machine.

I don't advertise to be a hardware or operating system expert here, these are just my 
observations that could be wrong. 
[Please send any comments to my way via GitHub](https://github.com/daniel-white/daniel-white.github.io/issues/new).

### Asynchronicity in hardware
Hardware I/O by its nature has always been asynchronous:

* `Insert disk 1 into floppy drive A:`
* `Press any key to continue...`
* Mouse button clicked
* Read file into memory from disk
* etc.

When the hardware wanted to inform the software running, it would signal interupts on the CPU.
I'm not sure of the complete details, but it was enough for primitive software to let the CPU
completely interupt what it was doing to handle the event. These events weren't CPU bound and 
were _asynchronous_ to the software running.

### Cooperative multitasking &amp; preemtive operating systems
Operating systems in the early 1990s weren't the multitasking behemoths that our modern
operating systems are today. Many were implemented with _cooperative multitasking_.

Essentially cooperative multitasking put the onus on the application developers to
play fair with other applications. Applications would have to be written in such a way to
yield control back to the operating system. There were no separate threads to worry about.

For instance, a call to `OpenFile` would return control to the operating system.

```c
OFSTRUCT reOpenBuff;
HFILE hFile = OpenFile("myFile.txt", &reOpenBuff, OF_READ);
// use the file
```

Eventually once the hardware informs the operating system (and other layers)
that the file is in memory, the operating then can reschedule the application.
To the application, the `OpenFile` call would simply block any other execution.

The mid-1990s brought preemptive multitasking operating systems to the main stream.
The operating system could control individual processes time on the CPU. At the time,
multiple CPUs weren't a thing. Thread APIs were exposed to get the illusion of 
concurrency in a single process - but the I/O calls still blocked threads and
threads are a constrained resource.
